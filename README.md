# GSL Frontpage Manager

This is a dedicated node.js server developed to manage front page news
on the English website of the Nagoya University Faculty of Law.

The server manages optional vetting of text by native-speaking staff,
distribution of event news to the student community by email, and
the rendering and uploading of front page news items to the static
website of the Faculty. Event items each contain and embedded calendar
link for scheduling convenience.

Unless otherwise indicated, the content of this repository is in the
public domain. You can do whatever you want with it.
