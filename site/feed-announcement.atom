&lt;p&gt;Pages in the &lt;strong&gt;Upcoming Events&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Curriculm&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; sections of the website now
carry spiffy calendar links (look for an icon decorated with a drop-shadow
effect).  Clicking on one of these links will automatically add the
relevant schedule information to the electronic diary included in
most modern computers and mobile devices. For the convenience of
overseas site visitors, calendar dates and times are set in universal
time, and will adjust to the visitor&#x27;s own timezone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that this new facility will make participating in the
life of the faculty that much easier for staff, students, and
both virtual and on-campus visitors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
