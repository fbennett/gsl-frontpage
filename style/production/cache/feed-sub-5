      <p>We are pleased to announce a presentation by Associate Professor Akiyoshi Yonezawa of GSID:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>International Human Resource Development at Nagoya University.</p>
</blockquote>

      <p>Professor Yonezawa is active both domestically and overseas in the study of internationalisation and curriculum management in Japanese higher education.</p>
<p>Amid the hue and cry over University internationalisation and global human resource development, this will be an opportunity, in our specific context, to reflect on practice, and on the significance and desirability of recent developments. Ample time will be reserved for discussion following Professor Yonezawa&#39;s presentation.</p>
<p>Instructors for University-wide course offerings in both Spring and Fall terms are encouraged to attend this event. (As previously noted to instructors, Faculty Development sessions are held just once in each year.)</p>
<p>This session is open to instructors only. The proceedings will be conducted in Japanese.</p>

            <h3>Session : University-wide Faculty Development Session</h3>
      <p>Tuesday, 1 April 2014, 14:45 - 16:00 (Zengau-kan S14)</p>
